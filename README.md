<h4> This repository contains programs coded in Java. <br></h4>
Prerequisites: <br>
&emsp;-> Java 1.8<br>
&emsp;-> JRE 7 <br>
Following is the list and brief descritpion of the programs. <br>
<h5>1. Diagonal.java </h5>
<h6>This program calculates the differences of the sum of the diagonals. <br>
Command line arguments:<br>
&emsp;- The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing &emsp; space-separated integers describing the columns.
</h6>
<h5>2. Staicase.java</h5>
<h6> This program aims in printing '#' in the form of the staircases based on the height provided by the user in the form of integer.<br>
Command line arguments: <br>
&emsp;- Provide integer N depicting the height of the staircase. Output will be based on N provided by the user.
</h6>
<h5>3. Timeconv.java</h5>
<h6> This program converts the time in 12 hour clock to a 24 hr clock format.<br>
Command line arguments: <br>
&emsp;- A single string containing a time in 12-hour clock format (i.e.:hh:mm:ssAM or hh:mm:ssPM),<br>&emsp; where 00<= hh <== 12; 00<= mm<= 60; 00<= ss<= 60.
</h6>
<h5>4. Max2.java</h5>
<h6>A program to determine the maximum of the two integers without using any conditional statements.<br>
Command line arguments: <br>
&emsp;- Provide two integers seperated with space.</h6>
<h5>5. Dictionary.java</h5>
<h6>
This program is implementing phone dictionary using HashMap.<br>
Command Line Arguments: <br>
&emsp;- Provide count of phone numbers in first place. <br>
&emsp;- Give Name and Number for all seperated by Enter. <br>
&emsp;- Then give the name of the user to be looked for to get their phone number. This return the number if user's details are stored or "not found".<br>
</h6>
<h5>6. ArrayReversal.java</h5>
<h6>
This program takes array of integers and store and print it in the reverse order. <br>
Command Line Arguments: <br>
&emsp;- Enter the count of elements to be stored in array. <br>
&emsp; Enter all the elements to be stored in the array. <br>
</h6>
<h5>7. BubbleSort.java</h5>
<h6>
This programs implements bubble sort algorithm sorts the array of integers in increasing order.
<br>This prints the number of swaps made to sort the array, first element and last element.<br>
Command Line Arguments:<br>
&emsp;- Provide with the array length.<br>
&emsp;- Print the array of integers.<br>
</h6>

<h5>8. Leftrotattion.java</h5>
<h6>
This program solves the problem of rotating an integer array in the left direction based on the count of rotations provided by the user. I have used algorithm similar to bubble sort to perform this.<br>
Command Line Arguments:<br>
&emsp;- Provide the length of the array and rotation count seperated by space<br>
&emsp;- Print the array of integers of that particular length.<br>
</h6>
<h5>9. Rightrotation.java</h5>
<h6>
This program solves the problem of rotating an integer array in the right direction based on the count of rotations provided by the user. I have used algorithm similar to bubble sort to perform this.<br>
Command Line Arguments:<br>
&emsp;- Provide the length of the array and rotation count seperated by space<br>
&emsp;- Print the array of integers of that particular length.<br>
